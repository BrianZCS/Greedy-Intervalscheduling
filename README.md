# Greedy-Intervalscheduling

The input will start with an positive integer, giving the number of instances that follow. For each
instance, there will be a positive integer, giving the number of jobs. For each job, there will be a pair of
positive integers i and j, where i < j, and i is the start time, and j is the end time.

For each instance, your program should output the number of intervals scheduled on a separate line.
O(n log n)

You can use "make" and "make run" to use the program.
